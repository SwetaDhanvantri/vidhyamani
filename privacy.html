           <p><h4> Cookies </h4>
             We send eyefuls (small lines containing a string of characters) to your computer, thereby uniquely 
             relating your cyber surfer. Cookies are used to track your preferences, help you log in briskly, 
             and aggregate to determine stoner trends. This data is used to ameliorate our immolations, 
             similar as furnishing further content in areas of lesser interest to a maturity of druggies.
              Utmost cyber surfers are originally set up to accept eyefuls, but you can reset your cyber surfer 
              to refuse all eyefuls or to indicate when a cookie is being transferred. Some of our features and 
              services may not serve duly if your eyefuls are impaired. </p>
            <p><h4> Links </h4>
             We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been 
             followed. We use this information to ameliorate our customized content. Clicking on links may take 
             you to spots outside our sphere. We aren't responsible for the sequestration practices of other 
             websites. We encourage our druggies to be apprehensive when they leave our point to read the
              sequestration statements of each and every website that collects tête-à-tête identifiable
               information. This Sequestration Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website. </p>
            <p><h4> Cautions </h4>
             We may warn you by dispatch or phone (through SMS/ call) to inform you about new service immolations 
             of the Company and its accessories/ cells or other information which we feel might be useful for you,
              through the Company or its accessories/ cells. </p>
             <p><h4>Public Forums </h4>
             When you use certain features on our website like the discussion forums and you post or partake your 
             particular information similar as commentary, dispatches, lines, prints, will be available to all 
             druggies, and will be in the public sphere. All similar sharing of information is done at your own 
             threat. Please keep in mind that if you expose particular information in your profile or when posting
              on our forums this information may come intimately available. </p>
             <p><h4>Security </h4>
             We're concerned about securing the confidentiality of your Information. We give physical, electronic,
              and procedural safeguards to cover the Information we reuse and maintain. For illustration, 
              we limit access to this information to authorized workers only who need to know that information in
               order to operate, develop or ameliorate our Operation/ Services/ products/ Website. 
               Please be apprehensive that, although we endeavour to give reasonable security for information 
               we reuse and maintain, no security system can help all implicit security breaches. </p>
             <p><h4>How Long Do We Retain Stoner Data? </h4>
             Presently, we plan to retain stoner data while an account is active and for at least three times 
             subsequently. We may alter this practice according to legal and business conditions. For illustration,
              we may outstretch the retention period for some data if demanded to misbehave with law or voluntary 
              canons of conduct. Unless else banned, we may dock the retention period for some types of data 
              if demanded to free up storehouse space.</p> 
            <p><h4> Log information </h4>
             When you pierce our Website, our waiters automatically record information that your cyber surfer 
             sends whenever you visit a website. These garcon logs may include information similar as your web
              request, internet protocol address, cyber surfer type, cyber surfer language, the date and time of 
              your request, and one or further eyefuls that may uniquely identify your cyber surfer. </p>
             
             <p><h4>Stoner dispatches</h4> 
            When you shoot a dispatch or other communication to us, we may retain those dispatches in order to 
            reuse your inquiries, respond to your requests and ameliorate our Services. </p>
             <p><h4>Changes to this Statement </h4>
             As the Company evolves, our sequestration policy will need to evolve as well to cover new situations.
              You're advised to review this Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is supposed
               blessing of all changes. </p>
             <p><h4>Your Concurrence</h4> 
            We believe that every stoner of our Operation/ Services/ products/ Website must be in a position to
